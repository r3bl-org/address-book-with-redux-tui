# address-book-with-redux-tui

This is a CLI app that implements an immutable data structure that represents an address
book. It also has a rich text user interface. Mutations to this address book must happen
via a Redux store, and actions that are dispatched to it. Along w/ a reducer function.

This app is meant to be a pedagogical example of how to use the `r3bl_rs_utils` crate
quite comprehensively.

# TODO

- Change the simple terminal UI to use r3bl_rs_utils `tui` module
